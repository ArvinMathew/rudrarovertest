My thought process is nothing
I have about an hour left, and i still dont know what I ma supposed to do
I dont know how to code a motor to "interpolate".
This is nothing like the coding I have done
How do I even code movement for something just knowing what motor it is
I have no clue about the attributes of the machine to actually "code the motor" move the rover back and forth
I am not even in the least bit tech savvy to even know how to download github or use it. I don't even know if this is were I am supposed to write this either.
My initial and final thought processes are nothing, with a major part in between being "OMG I dont have internet" and "OMG i couldve googled the answers", which i couldnt because the internet.
I barely even understand what i need to do, to understand what i actually need to code.
